## QR Code Generator API
I needed a QR Code for my cat's vet last week. I found a website for code generating and I did use it. There are sent me an email about my generated code and why it is canceled.

There are want a package from me and it is so expensive in my country. I thought about it, how can I generate a completely free QR Code? I researched it and I did.

QR Code Generator API is written in Python/Django and Django Rest Framework. I started developing the app on Sunday.

I have a little TODO list for other versions and after I will complete the app with React App.

**Todo List:**
- Add different data types like rgb and rgba codes for gradient QR Code generating.
- Add update endpoint for created QR Codes and re-generate qr code function.
- Create a React App
    - Login Page
    - Register Page
    - Profile Page, Update Password and Change Email features
    - Generate QR Code Page
    - List Codes Page
    - Update Generate Code Page

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL

## How to install
Create an virtual environment:
```shell
python -m venv venv
or
virtualenv venv
```

Install the pip packages:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create an environment file with the name `.env` like:
```text
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=secret_key
HOST=localhost
USER=postgres
PASSWORD=12345
NAME=qrcode
PORT=5432
```

## Authentication
I use TokenAuthentication for API endpoints. If you want to use QR Code Generator API, you must have a user account. You can create a user account with the register endpoint and you can get an authentication token with the login endpoint.
